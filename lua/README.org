* Helper imap-filter support
** Note Well
   This is automatically included by 
   imap-filter. You may modify what is
   here to alter the DSL or to include
   additional support automatically.

   But be very weary of making changes
   here, because you could break things. So
   know what you are doing.
   There be dragons here!
